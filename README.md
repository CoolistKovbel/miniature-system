# Welcome to the Mystic Kitten Community

This is a small NFT collection minting chat website where you are able to mint a nft from the MysticMurko Collection. There are a limited amount of these tokens. About 222. They are cute little kittens symbolizing my dead cat murko. He was one awesome cat. You probably dont know him but hey you can see there are different version of him now. Preety cute if you ask me right.

The Mystic Murko NFT will be my first NFT collection that will be held very dear to me and for those who decide to support my ART and project will be remebered and whitelisted to feautre projects that I hope to be able to launch this year.

## The Basics
This is will be an open site where you wont need to really mint a nft to interact with it but those who do manage to get one will have the power to create their own channels where they can then have users join and create their own sub communities with.

Those without the NFT will be able to join the avaible servers for a price, but once in you will be able in them forever.

You will also be able to "meow" or give out an announcement. Why? Well maybe sometimes poeple want to share what they are doing or what service they provide or just want to notify others that they too have a nft. 

I would like to make this fun and friendly to allow people who are interested in the blockchain a chance to really get their mind blow with how different things will slowly transition. 

I hate to say this but things wouldve been a whole lot better if I took the time to design it a little better or actually go through the little teaching i put myself through back in 2019 but got compromised and honestly toxic behavoirs from everyone around me leading me to loose everything. 

I am tired of sharing sob stories, it doesnt get me too sad just gets me very very very very VERY MF ANGRY that I ALLOWED SUCH THINGS TO HAPPEN WHEN I SHOULDVE JUST TRUSTED MY GUT. but it was either love or a amazing future where you possibly wouldve understood who or what I am or capable of. but toxic girls, woman, and men like to destory futures of those who think they will shine brighter than them or just cant belive I am who i am and did what I did and called that life. 

Why leave home when they allow me to get my shit situated... suprised i didnt kill myself. 

### ETC
Seems like I talk a lot hope i make sense. I am tired living in regret. Not my coup of coffee.


Also please stop the wars... the fighting ... the drama ... the hate.... I hope to make it better.
